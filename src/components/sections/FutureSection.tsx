                        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4">The future of computational pharmacology points towards a convergence of currently distinct disciplines. Historically, PBPK (Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics), PK/PD (Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic), and QSP (Quantitative Systems Pharmacology) models have often existed in silos, each serving specific purposes at different stages of drug development‚Äîfrom early discovery to non-clinical, clinical, and clinical operations. PBPK focuses on drug movement, PK/PD links drug concentration to its effects, and QSP models complex biological systems and disease pathways.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4">Our integrated GNN-PBPK-AI/LLM framework lays the groundwork for dissolving these traditional boundaries. By mechanistically modeling drug disposition (PBPK), predicting ADME/PK parameters (AI/GNN), and leveraging LLMs for biological reasoning and hypothesis generation (QSP-like insights), we envision a seamless, continuous feedback loop across the entire pipeline. This convergence will allow for:</p>
